<center><h3>About Us</h3></center>

In 2012, we started Urban Ladder with a vision - to make a million homes beautiful.
Back then, our catalogue featured just 35 designs. Yet, when our customers shared
photographs of their homes, we saw they were remarkably distinct. The same table, the
same chair was used differently by different people. This told us something. People
want their homes to be unique. We also realized that people are a lot happier creating
things than they are buying things. We are a creative, imaginative, expressive species.
And our homes are just one of the many canvases we have at our disposal.

Today, we understand that we’re here not just to sell well-designed products. We’re
here to help you create spaces that mirror who you are. At Urban Ladder, we want you
to discover the joy of creating. Starting with your home. We want you to think of the
setting up of a space as an energizing, creative pursuit. To breathe life into empty
rooms with your ideas. To take a few square feet of nothing, and transform it into
something beautiful.
